Herein, the name <i>capensis</i> will be restricted to the South African hare, and other names applied to East and North African, and Arabian-Near Eastern hares.

Herein, the name <i>capensis</i> will be restricted to the South African hare, and other names applied to East and North African, and Arabian-Near Eastern hares.

The taxonomy was changed again to O. argentata in 2003, as O. helanshanensis is apparently a synonym of O. argentata and new biological evidence indicates the form was an independent species (A. Smith pers. comm.). Karyotype (2n = 38), morphological, and vocalization differences validated the classification of O. argentata as a true species (Formozov et al. 2004). However, a recent molecular phylogenetic analysis contradicts past evidence regarding taxonomic standing, suggesting that O. argentata be included once again in O. pallasi (Lissovsky et al. 2007); this has not been followed here.","","China (Ningxia)",NA
