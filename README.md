This repository holds the scripts and data needed to recreate the results for this project. Also are methods documents for how we extracted certain datasets.

They are organized the following:

Data
- ranges.csv for natural ranges extracted from <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ddi.12369">Faurby & Svenning 2015</a>
- age.csv for fossil ages of species extracted from the <a href="https://paleobiodb.org/#/">PBDB</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790314003844?casa_token=z-aihi0A1bEAAAAA:hKwGauYa23y7lp3yKZvnWds0OrmpsdoIWxV5ywBT8InkrpXGBbCOPI-0wfrRcIKvjUpI-EiHFRk">Faurby & Svenning 2015</a> (see Methods below)

Scripts
- Init.R for generating the file used for analyses here 
- DataExploration.R to understand data structure
- H1-AgeOfClades.R to investigate how the age of the lineage may influence geographic range
- H2-DiversityOfClades.R
- H3-BodySize.R
- H4-Diet.R for diet-related analyses, included diet type and diet breadth
- H5-GeographicRange.R, including the SÃ¸renson Index

Methods
- Age for how we extracted two different age metrics
- The types of methods used for majority of our analyses
