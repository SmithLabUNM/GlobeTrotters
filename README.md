# GlobeTrotters

This repository holds the scripts and data needed to recreate the results for this project. Also are methods documents for how we extracted certain datasets.

They are organized the following:

Data
- ranges.csv for natural ranges extracted from Faurby
- age.csv for fossil ages of species extracted from the PBDB and Faurby (see Methods below)

Scripts
- Init for generating the file used for analyses here 
- Diet for diet-related analyses, included diet type and diet breadth
- Body size for size-related analyses
- Fossil for age-related analyses
- Range for geographic range-related, such as the SÃ¸renson index, analyses

Methods
- Age for how we extracted two different age metrics
- The types of methods used for majority of our analyses
